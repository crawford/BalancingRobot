## Research Project Knowns/Unknowns/Questions/Ideas/Needs
This is a brainstorming session about your research project. Answer the following questions with as much detail as you know or don't know at this point. This will be the basis of conversations you have with the instructor in this class or the next one to launch your research project. Hopefully, as the project progresses, unknowns will become knows, ideas will be bright, and all your questions will be answered and needs met. Submit this to the dropbox before the end of the class session.
